# Coatact-Management-System
This is a program that is used by a person or an organization to manage their contact information. The user can add and remove contacts to this program and can be later viewed by the client or the programmer for later use. The data collected from the user is stored in a SQLite server. Tkinter is used as the skeleton visual structure for the program.
